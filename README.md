### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes the labs did prepare me for the assignment. Coming from someone who has very minimal previous experience with HTML and CSS, it was all very useful. I felt that I was a little unprepared to complete the felx features, but not because there wasn't enough resources, it was just because I felt that there was a bit of a learning curve.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have tried to implement a lot more of the stretch features as I didnt really get to them. I would have liked to embed a maps feature for the food guide or a video.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I feel that the overall structure of the website went pretty well. Specifically, I think creating the navigation went really smoothly. What didn't go as planned is using the flex features as I had trouble navigating it. Lastly, I noticed that a few peers had the images pop up when hovering over them and I think that would be cool to implement.

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.
